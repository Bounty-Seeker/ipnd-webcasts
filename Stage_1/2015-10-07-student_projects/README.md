Sharing Student Projects
==========================================

Here is a link to the [Webcast][WB]

#Overview

 A slightly different webcast where we interview students who have completed the nanodegree. We hear about their successes, their struggles, and their plans. We know that the nanodegree is difficult, so we wanted to give everyone a taste of what the end product could look like. Since this is a student focused webcast, I'll keep the notes here minimal so that the students can speak for themselves.

## [Kalindi](https://youtu.be/oujpRDsC-o4?t=1m29s)

Kalindi shows off her project which has a slick javascript game included with it. Check it out [here](http://my-ipnd.appspot.com/)! She had some trouble with stage 4, like everyone, but was able to get through it when she broke the problem down into its components. Her last piece of advice: 'Use a lot of print statements!'

## [Bonnie](https://youtu.be/oujpRDsC-o4?t=9m37s)
Bonnie showed off her project which you can see [here](http://stage5bonnie.appspot.com/). She was also very proud of the resume that she built for front end. She had to adapt to the feedback community in Udacity and found that it worked much better for her than just struggling through on her own. Bonnie works at AT&T and feels that she is much better able to communicate with tech-related coworkers and clients after going through the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.

## [Andreas](https://youtu.be/oujpRDsC-o4?t=17m28s)
Andreas started out the nanodegree with programming experience and was able to build [this](http://kinetic-silicon-104012.appspot.com/) by the end. He built a responsive design website using bootstrap that will work on any size screen. With his new skills he's looking for a job as a web designer in Madrid. Good luck Andreas!

## [Kyren](https://youtu.be/oujpRDsC-o4?t=24m43s)
Kyren showed off some javascript skills in his webpage [here](http://note-project.appspot.com/). He used JS to help keep the code clean when the HTML and CSS was becoming too messy. He also used github to organize all of his files. Kyren used to be a mechanical engineering major in college, but switched over to computer science after experiencing what it was like to program computers through the community of Udacity. Good luck Kyren!
