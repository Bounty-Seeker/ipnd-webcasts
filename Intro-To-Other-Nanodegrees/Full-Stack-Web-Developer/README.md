Webcast: About the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
==========================================

Here is a link to the [video][OH]

#What is Full-Stack Web Development?
-what is front-end?
-what is back-end?
-full-stack is the combination of those
-you know all aspects of making a web application


#What is the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree about?
- work with a lot of different tools and technologies
    - databases
    - Google App Engine
    - Flask, a Python web framework (like webapp2)
    - OAuth - think facebook or google sign-in with your app
    - virtual machines (what are these?)
- build web applications and host them
- learn a lot of new things
- will set you up well for future projects




#What is expected pre-requisite knowledge?  
- Front-End experience
    - you will be designing web applications
    - not a whole lot of JS is required
- Basic Python experience
    - functions
    - classes
    - loops
    - that’s pretty much all you need to start. we teach you the rest


###What gaps may need to be filled in from IPND (the Intro to Programming Nanodegree)?
- you’re ready!
- Full-Stack IF you like Python
- Front-End IF you like working with HTML/CSS more

  2.  How to use the .yaml file
  3.  How to navigate folders appropriately when referencing different files
  4.  Google Datastore  
  5.  How to use webapp2
  6.  How to use jinja2 templates
  7.  How to ue Python dictionaries
  8.  How to use the modulus operator in Python
    
#####From Stage 5:
  Develope awareness of some other concepts in computing, like:
   1.  Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life.
   2.  Using APIs to easily access powerful data.
   3.  Recursion 
   4.  Parallel computing.
   5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
   6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

####What any student needs to know before taking the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree:


####What to learn after IPND but before taking the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree:


#What will students learn in the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree?  

##What is the structure of the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree?  
Nanodegree Structure

These are the projects you'll build and the classes that will prepare you to build each of the projects. You'll have access to all these in the Nanodegree:

###Project: Movie Trailer Website

You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

###Course: Programming Foundations with Python
You will already have taken this full course in IPND!

###Project: Tournament Results

You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

###Course: Intro to Relational Databases
You'll explore a different kind of database, similar to the Google Datastore you work with in stage 4 of IPND

###Project: Item Catalog

You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

###Course:  Full Stack Foundations 

###Course:  Authentication and Authorization 


###Project: Conference Organization App

You will develop a cloud-based API server to support a provided conference organization application that exists on the web as well as a native Android application. The API supports the following functionality found within the app: user authentication, user profiles, conference information and various manners in which to query the data.

###Course: Developing Scalable Apps with Python

###Project: Linux-based Server Configuration

You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

###Course: Linux Basics for Web Developers

###How will skills learned in IPND transfer to FSND?





#What kind of career does the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree prepare you for?  


###From Engineers you've talked to, what do they like the most about being a full stack developer?

####What about you two?

###What does planning for a project look like for a Full-Stack Web Developer?
