#What is the Data Analyst Nanodegree about?
This Nanodegree program is the most efficient curriculum to prepare you for a job as a Data Analyst. You will learn to:

Wrangle, extract, transform, and load data from various databases, formats, and data sources
Use exploratory data analysis techniques to identify meaningful relationships, patterns, or trends from complex data sets
Classify unlabeled data or predict into the future with applied statistics and machine learning algorithms
Communicate data analysis and findings well through effective data visualizations
You will work with your peers and advisors on projects approved by leading employers as the critical indicators of job-readiness. We designed these projects with expert Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and hiring managers.

You'll also have the opportunity to prepare for your new career with reviews of your online presence (resume, LinkedIn, portfolio), prepare for interviews, take part in workshops covering topics like networking and salary negotiation as well as take part in a new program facilitating job placement.

Ready to get started? Take the [Readiness Assessment](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-none/l-2364518584), which will help you determine if you have the right background to participate.

####Why Take This Nanodegree?

The Data Analyst nanodegree is designed to prepare you for a career in data science. As a Data Analyst, you will be responsible for obtaining, analyzing, and effectively reporting on data insights ranging from business metrics to user behavior and product performance.

Working with our leading industry partners, we’ve carefully designed the most efficient set of projects to train you on the fundamental skills of data science and help you become a Data Analyst.

#Expected Prerequisite Knowledge  
Data Analyst nanodegree students...
 - are interested in data science.
 - have a strong grasp of descriptive and inferential statistics.
 - have python programming experience.
 - have a strong understanding of programming concepts such as variables, functions, loops, and basic data structures like lists and dictionaries.

#####Prerequisite:

The first thing you should do is take the [Readiness Assessment](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-none/l-2364518584), which will help you determine if you have the right background to participate.

######General Requirements:

- You are self-driven and motivated to learn. Participation in this program requires consistently meeting the deadlines for your cohort and devoting at least 10 hours per week to your work.
- You can communicate fluently and professionally in written and spoken English.
- You have access to a computer with a broadband connection, on which you’ll install a professional code/text editor (ie. Sublime Text or Atom) and programming languages like Python and R and associating data science libraries.
- You are willing to contribute to the success of the program, including collaborating with fellow students and giving us feedback on how we can improve.


###What gaps may need to be filled in from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree?

First, it's probably useful to go over what you will learn (or have learned) in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree:

#####What you learn in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree

#####From Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how they fit together.  You'll get practice with developing your own static web pages, building the foundations with HTML and formatting them with CSS.  You'll learn a variety of HTML tags and attributes, as well as how to use them.  

You will also learn how to use various tools common in programming, like a text editor (we use Sublime Text).

#####From Stage 2:
In stage 2 you will learn the basics of Python, including:
  1.  Strings
  2.  Loops (for and while)
  3.  Variables
  4.  If statements
  5.  Types (like int, str, and bool)
  6.  Lists
  7.  Tuples
  8.  Mutability
  9.  Functions
  10.  Return statements
  11.  Print statements
  12.  Debugging Python code
  13.  Problem Solving

This will set you up to be able to build your own programs!

#####From Stage 3:
In stage 3, you will continue learning Python, this time getting into its object oriented side.  Here you will learn about:
  1.  Classes 
  2.  Objects
  3.  Methods
  4.  Instances
  5.  Instance variables
  6.  Inheritance
  7.  Method Overriding
  8.  Import Statements
  9.  The Python Standard Library
  10.  Importing External Libraries
  11.  Using documentation

#####From Stage 4:
In stage 4 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will build the backend of a website using Python and Google App Engine.  You'll learn:
  1.  How to install, run, and deploy with Google App Engine
  2.  How to use the .yaml file with GAE (Google App Engine)
  3.  How to navigate folders appropriately when referencing different files with GAE
  4.  Google Datastore  
  5.  How to use the webapp2 framework
  6.  How to use jinja2 templates
  7.  How to use Python dictionaries
  8.  How to use the modulus operator in Python

#####From Stage 5:
Stage 5 in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree will provide awareness of a variety of things instead of providing a higher level of competency.  Some of the concepts in computing you will develop awareness about will be:
  1.  Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life.
  2.  Using APIs to easily access powerful data.
  3.  Recursion 
  4.  Parallel computing
  5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
  6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

Now we can move into what a student will need to know before taking the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

####Going into the Data Analyst Nanodegree from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree
You should hopefully have developed some level of mastery over object oriented concepts in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree.  It would most likely still be useful to take all of [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101) in order to master various programming concepts.

Additionally, you will need to take [How to Use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) in order to learn how to use Git and Github effectively, which is a requirement for starting the Android Developer Nanodegree.  This will be used for submitting projects, collaborating with your peers and coaches, and is generally a very useful skill to have, so this knowledge this course teaches is recommended for all of our other Nanodegrees as well.  



##What students will learn in the Data Analyst Nanodegree

Tell Stories with Data Visualization 
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. Your work will be a reflection of the theory and best practices of data visualization.

Prepare for this project with: [Data Visualization](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud507)

Design and Analyze an A/B Test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

Prepare for this project with: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud257)


We will be periodically reviewing the Data Analyst Nanodegree curriculum - both courses and projects - and making adjustments based on student and industry feedback. We will notify active students working toward the Nanodegree about any effects updates may have on the degree requirements.
