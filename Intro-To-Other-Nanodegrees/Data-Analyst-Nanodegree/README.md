Webcast: About the Data-Analyst Nanodegree
==========================================

Here is a link to the [video][OH]

#What is Data Analysis?
Data Analysis can mean a large variety of things, but in our context, we interpret it as such:

Analyzing Data, coming up with insights into data, presenting it to others, and reformulating the data into something you can share.

#What is the Data Analyst Nanodegree about?
This Nanodegree program is the most efficient curriculum to prepare you for a job as a Data Analyst. You will learn to:

Wrangle, extract, transform, and load data from various databases, formats, and data sources
Use exploratory data analysis techniques to identify meaningful relationships, patterns, or trends from complex data sets
Classify unlabeled data or predict into the future with applied statistics and machine learning algorithms
Communicate data analysis and findings well through effective data visualizations
You will work with your peers and advisors on projects approved by leading employers as the critical indicators of job-readiness. We designed these projects with expert Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and hiring managers.

You'll also have the opportunity to prepare for your new career with reviews of your online presence (resume, LinkedIn, portfolio), prepare for interviews, take part in workshops covering topics like networking and salary negotiation as well as take part in a new program facilitating job placement.

###What gaps may need to be filled in from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree?

First, it's probably useful to go over what you will learn (or have learned) in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree:

#####What you learn in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree

#####From Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how they fit together.  You'll get practice with developing your own static web pages, building the foundations with HTML and formatting them with CSS.  You'll learn a variety of HTML tags and attributes, as well as how to use them.  

You will also learn how to use various tools common in programming, like a text editor (we use Sublime Text).

#####From Stage 2:
In stage 2 you will learn the basics of Python, including:
  1.  Strings
  2.  Loops (for and while)
  3.  Variables
  4.  If statements
  5.  Types (like int, str, and bool)
  6.  Lists
  7.  Tuples
  8.  Mutability
  9.  Functions
  10.  Return statements
  11.  Print statements
  12.  Debugging Python code
  13.  Problem Solving

This will set you up to be able to build your own programs!

#####From Stage 3:
In stage 3, you will continue learning Python, this time getting into its object oriented side.  Here you will learn about:
  1.  Classes 
  2.  Objects
  3.  Methods
  4.  Instances
  5.  Instance variables
  6.  Inheritance
  7.  Method Overriding
  8.  Import Statements
  9.  The Python Standard Library
  10.  Importing External Libraries
  11.  Using documentation

#####From Stage 4:
In stage 4 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will build the backend of a website using Python and Google App Engine.  You'll learn:
  1.  How to install, run, and deploy with Google App Engine
  2.  How to use the .yaml file with GAE (Google App Engine)
  3.  How to navigate folders appropriately when referencing different files with GAE
  4.  Google Datastore  
  5.  How to use the webapp2 framework
  6.  How to use jinja2 templates
  7.  How to use Python dictionaries
  8.  How to use the modulus operator in Python

#####From Stage 5:
Stage 5 in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree will provide awareness of a variety of things instead of providing a higher level of competency.  Some of the concepts in computing you will develop awareness about will be:
  1.  Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life.
  2.  Using APIs to easily access powerful data.
  3.  Recursion 
  4.  Parallel computing
  5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
  6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

Now we can move into what a student will need to know before taking the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

####Going into the Data Analyst Nanodegree from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree


###READYNESS ASSESSMENT
Prerequisites
Before you begin, it is important to ensure you are ready to embark on this journey and will benefit from it as much as possible.

Please answer the following questions as best you can to help us guide you to the learning path that makes the most sense for you. If you have taken the Readiness Assessment previously, please feel free to skip this section.

Please note that in the Readiness Assessment you will get your hands dirty with a little programming and probability.

Programming 
If you feel that you don't yet have the necessary programming background for this program, you can take the following courses on Udacity to prepare:

[Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)
[Intro to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036)
Statistics
We've found that many students who enroll in the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program have taken statistics in college, or sometime prior to their enrollment, but often they need review of certain key concepts in order to be successful. With this in mind, the first course in this Nanodegree Program will help you review statistics, beginning with a special placement advisor, which will tell you the specific lessons you need to work through. As a result of this addition, you will not be asked any questions about statistics in the following Readiness Assessment.

Pay attention to the feedback that will appear in the box to the right after each submission. It's okay if you don't get the questions right the first time. Go to the resources that we share with you to review or learn something new. Once you've done that, you can come back and try the questions again!

####Time Commitment
With 10 hours of work per week, we expect you will complete this nanodegree (and start applying for jobs) in about 9 to 12 months.

Students who set aside regular time to work are significantly more likely to complete this Nanodegree. Make sure you set a schedule and then stick to it. Online courses are a unique learning experience. We recommend blocking out time in your schedule every week so that working on your Nanodegree becomes an established part of your routine. That way, you'll stay motivated and keep making progress!


####Bayes rule
Although Statistics are reviewed in the Nanodegree, probability is not.  You don't need to know any Bayesian statistics, although it again could help you some of what is happening 'underneath the hood' in some of the algorithms you use.  If you think you would benefit from going over Bayes rule, you may find the first lesson of [AI for Robotics](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/knowlabs.com/rolandnturner?authuser=0) to be particularly useful.


You should hopefully have developed some level of mastery over object oriented concepts in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree.  It would most likely still be useful to take all of [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101) in order to master various programming concepts.  You will need to use data structures very extensively in DAND, and this is something which CS101 will give you more information on data structures than IPND does.  

It may be helpful to know linear algebra, as you will technically be using it in much of machine learning, but you don't strictly speaking need to know it for the Data Analysis Nanodegree.

You will need to be very comfortable looking up how to do things, especially in the Python docs.  DAND may throw things you aren't used to in Python, like list comprehensions or File I/O, which you'll be able to look up in the docs as you go.  


##What students will learn in the Data Analyst Nanodegree 

###The Data Analyst Nanodegree Structure 
Nanodegree Structure

These are the projects you'll build and the classes that will prepare you to build each of the projects. You'll have access to all these in the Nanodegree:

#####Project: 7 day WARM-UP: Find the Optimal Chopstick Length
An opportunity to get your feet wet and get some quick feedback about your progress in the first week of the program.

Set up IPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries on your own computer. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal length of chopsticks and present your findings.

######Prepare for this project with: [Lesson 1 of Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud827/l-1293178557)

#####Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

######Prepare for this project with: Statistics (available separately as [Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud201) and [Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud827))

#####Project: Predict the New York City Subway Ridership

Learn fundamental data science skills like data wrangling, applied statistics and machine learning, and effective visualization. Pose a question about the New York City Subway and work with the subway ridership dataset to draw an interesting conclusion about the dataset itself.

######Prepare for this project with: [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud359)

Intro to Data Science gives a broad overview of each of the stages of data analysis.  In the first part, you clean and shape the data into something you can work with.  The second part would be about analyzing the data using statistical tests, linear regression, 

The next step is about how to visualize the data, how to present your findings, how to construct graphs and visualizations, etc.

The following courses then go into each of those steps in more detail.  

#####Project: Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data 
Choose any area of the world in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

######Prepare for this project with: [Data Wrangling with MongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032)

This course will get into the nitty-gritty of wrangling and cleaning data.  This teaches how to get data from various sources, like csv, excel, or xml files, APIs, or webpages.  It also shows you how to shape the data into the form you want to analyze it in, and how to put data into a non-relational database called MongoDB, which stores data in documents similar to JSON.  The course uses Python extensively.

#####Project: Explore, Summarize, and Discover Interesting Insights from Datasets 
Use R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques. Practice understanding a single variable and relationships between multiple variables, and explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

######Prepare for this project with: [Data Analysis with R](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud651)

This course focuses on exploratory data analysis.   This is one of the most overlooked aspects of data analysis; what is the data set, what will you be working with?  A big part of this is looking at plots, histograms, etc., and getting a deep understanding of your dataset, including any biases in your dataset.  This will allow you to possibly consider doing a more in-depth analysis, or going back and recollecting data without the flaws you find.  This class will be in R; it doesn't assume you have any R knowledge, and will teach you the basics of R.

#####Project: Identify Fraud from the Enron Email Dataset 
Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

######Prepare for this project with: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120)

Machine learning is using algorithms and statistical methods to make predictions and insights about data.  This course covers a wide variety of topics, and gives a broad introduction to the subject, including different approaches, processes and methods.  You learn how to chose your features, how to chose what knowledge you'll need to make predictions, how to gauge the performance of your predictions, and how to improve on it and get a better and better model.  

#####Project: Tell Stories with Data Visualization 
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. Your work will be a reflection of the theory and best practices of data visualization.

######Prepare for this project with: [Data Visualization](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud507)
The main thing of this course is the science of data visualization.    It goes into how to construct good visualizations, how to encode your data with visualizations, what the advantages and disadvantages for displaying data in different ways.  This is also a key part of data science; how to present an analysis to your peers and those who are not familiar with the dataset. 

This course will be using JavaScript, specifically the d3 library.  If you've ever seen a plot where you see an image where points move around and shift based on what filters you apply, it was probably made with this library.  

#####Project: Design and Analyze an A/B Test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

######Prepare for this project with: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud257)

A/B testing is a bit separate from the rest of what you'll be learning in the nanodegree.  Almost any large website will do A/B testing; you try a small change, and compare an A group (with the change) from a B group (without the change), and the results from the test will inform a decision on whether or not to make the change.  


We will be periodically reviewing the Data Analyst Nanodegree curriculum - both courses and projects - and making adjustments based on student and industry feedback. We will notify active students working toward the Nanodegree about any effects updates may have on the degree requirements.


###Curriculum Length: How long does the whole Nanodegree take?
The nanodegree is slotted to take about a year and a month; there are, after all, quite a few courses in this Nanodegree.

###Project Difficulty Levels
Data Science is composed of at least three different skills; Programming, Statistical Analysis, and Data Visualization.  Depending on what your background is before coming into the Nanodegree, you may find some courses more difficult than others.  Data Wrangling is probably the most difficult course on the programming end, while A/B Testing is the hardest course from the Statistical end.  

###Data Analysis Tools
You'll learn how to use a variety of tools in the Data Analysis Nanodegree.  These include pandas, numpy, sci-kit, and a bunch of Machine Learning tools, but these things change through time.  Because of this, learning how to use documentation efficiently is a major key to success in both the Data Analysis Nanodegree and in the field.  

###What roles does this Nanodegree track prepare you for?
It prepares you to be a Data Analysist.  This could actually go under quite a few different job titles:  Data Analysist, Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Analyst, etc.  They may not all be the same job, but the names are frequently used interchangeably.  

The content doesn't directly go into BioInformatics, although you will develop many of the skills that would go with that.

No matter what you go into, though, knowledge of statistics is greatly beneficial, but it isn't a substitute for domain expertise.  Any time you can have some insight and intuition about data, it greatly helps to catch any errors you may make in data analysis.  

By the end of the Data Analysis Nanodegree, you will be able to take any realistic form of data, explore the data, shape it, display it, and do some predictive analysis on it.
