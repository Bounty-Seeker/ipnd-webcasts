#What is the Android Developer Nanodegree about?
Learn to develop for Android and transform your career outlook! This Nanodegree will provide a guided, efficient path for an intermediate developer with little or no experience on mobile platforms to emerge as an Android Developer.

By the end of the Nanodegree, you'll have a diverse portfolio of projects to show employers, and will even publish your own app on the Google Play Store as part of the Capstone project.

This is an Intermediate Nanodegree: Entering students are expected to have prior experience building applications (web or mobile) in Java or another object-oriented programming language.

Why Take This Nanodegree?

With over 1 billion Android devices already activated, Android represents an incredible opportunity for developers. As Android continues to grow beyond smartphones, it will become the brains behind invisible, ubiquitous cloud-connected computing. The skills you learn in this Nanodegree will help you master the existing platform, and prepare you for the exciting opportunities in Android's future.

#Expected Prerequisite Knowledge  
###What is Expected Prerequisite Knowledge to start the Android Developer Nanodegree?
This will be a challenging and rewarding journey that will take a novice programmer 9 months or longer to complete, spending an estimated 10 hours per week on the coursework. Do you have the dedication and mindset to sustain you through it? If you're not sure, please check out the courses and projects, listed under Nanodegree Structure, before making this commitment.

Programming Experience

This is not a "Zero to Hero" program. Entering students are expected to have prior experience building applications (web or mobile) in Java or another object-oriented programming language.

You should have at least 1-2 years of experience in Java or another object-oriented programming language prior to enrolling.

If you have no prior programming experience, we recommend you take our Android Development for Beginners course, also built with Google. You should also learn foundational Java programming concepts before enrolling in this Nanodegree. Our Intro to Java course may be a good place to start.

Technical Skills and Requirements

You will submit your projects on GitHub, and must have a GitHub handle and know how to share code prior to enrolling. Take our course on How to Use Git and GitHub if you need to learn how to do this.
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub, specifically how to: clone a branch, fork, and create a new repository.

You will build your apps in Android Studio, and will need to install it on your machine to complete your Nanodegree projects. If you don't have Android Studio installed, see our mini-course on How to Install Android Studio for instructions.

Dedication and Mindset

In addition to 1-2 years of prior programming experience and intermediate technical skills, students are expected to demonstrate the following characteristics:

Resourcefulness: Ability to search for and find solutions in documentation, backed by the belief that all problems in code are discoverable;
Grit: Ability to work through challenges and persevere when code breaks and tests fail.
Growth Mindset: Belief that intelligence is NOT a fixed entity, and can be boosted by hard work in the process of learning and practice.

There is also a [Readiness Assessment](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-none/l-3098108743); taking that should give you a sense as to your preparedness to enter the Android Developer Nanodegree.

In summary, before starting the Android Developer Nanodegree, you should have a strong understanding of programming concepts like variables, if statements, loops, functions, and classes. Additionally, you should have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub, specifically how to: clone a branch, fork, and create a new repository.


###What gaps may need to be filled in from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree?

First, it's probably useful to go over what you will learn (or have learned) in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree:

#####What you learn in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree

#####From Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how they fit together.  You'll get practice with developing your own static web pages, building the foundations with HTML and formatting them with CSS.  You'll learn a variety of HTML tags and attributes, as well as how to use them.  

You will also learn how to use various tools common in programming, like a text editor (we use Sublime Text).

#####From Stage 2:
In stage 2 you will learn the basics of Python, including:
1.  Strings
2.  Loops (for and while)
3.  Variables
4.  If statements
5.  Types (like int, str, and bool)
6.  Lists
7.  Tuples
8.  Mutability
9.  Functions
10.  Return statements
11.  Print statements
12.  Debugging Python code
13.  Problem Solving

This will set you up to be able to build your own programs!

#####From Stage 3:
In stage 3, you will continue learning Python, this time getting into its object oriented side.  Here you will learn about:
1.  Classes 
2.  Objects
3.  Methods
4.  Instances
5.  Instance variables
6.  Inheritance
7.  Method Overriding
8.  Import Statements
9.  The Python Standard Library
10.  Importing External Libraries
11.  Using documentation

#####From Stage 4:
In stage 4 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will build the backend of a website using Python and Google App Engine.  You'll learn:
1.  How to install, run, and deploy with Google App Engine
2.  How to use the .yaml file with GAE (Google App Engine)
3.  How to navigate folders appropriately when referencing different files with GAE
4.  Google Datastore  
5.  How to use the webapp2 framework
6.  How to use jinja2 templates
7.  How to use Python dictionaries
8.  How to use the modulus operator in Python

#####From Stage 5:
Stage 5 in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree will provide awareness of a variety of things instead of providing a higher level of competency.  Some of the concepts in computing you will develop awareness about will be:
1.  Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life.
2.  Using APIs to easily access powerful data.
3.  Recursion 
4.  Parallel computing
5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

Now we can move into what a student will need to know before taking the Android Developer Nanodegree.

####Going into the Android Developer Nanodegree from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree
You should hopefully have developed some level of mastery over object oriented concepts in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree.  It would most likely still be useful to take all of [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101) in order to master various programming concepts.

Additionally, you will need to take [How to Use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) in order to learn how to use Git and Github effectively, which is a requirement for starting the Android Developer Nanodegree.  This could be taken after you start the Android Developer Nanodegree, but it is a knowledge base that will be used significantly during the Android Developer Nanodegree.  This is true of most of Udacity's Nanodegrees; knowledge of Git and Github will be used extensively in the course, but the course can be taken during the Nanodegree instead of before hand if a student prefers to do so.
