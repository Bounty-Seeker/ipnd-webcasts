#What is Front-End Web Development?
Front-End Web Development is the creation of everything you see on the web.  Every website you go to, all the suff you are seeing is made with Front-End Web Development.  

The main technologies being used are HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), which creates the content and basic structure of web pages, CSS (cascading style sheets), which creates the styles, animations and transitions of webpages, and Javascript, which is the actual programming language used by the web.  Javascript is used for everything from running scripts, to running animations, or basically do anything you really want to do in a browser.  Front-End web development is the combination of these three things to make content that is presentable to a user or a client.

#What is the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree about?
The Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree will take students from a basic understanding of the web.  It will introduce those web technoknoledgies (HTML, CSS, and Javascript), which, if you've gone through the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will already have some understanding and comfort level with before you start.  On top of getting comfortable with those technologies, FEND will also go over how browsers work and how to optimize a webpage for performance, so that it runs quickly for users.  FEND will also dive into common design patterns used on the web to make your work more organized and make it easier to work with larger teams and on larger web projects.  Aside from that, it's all about getting started and getting up and running on the web.  Getting the ability to make amazing web apps with the tools that are out there.

   4.  Parallel computing.
   5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
   6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

####Going into FEND from IPND
Since you already learn a little bit of HTML and CSS, as well as a little bit of Javascript and Responsive Web design, so you will be well set up to join the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  Because of the afore mentioned experience in IPND, you'll be set up for success with FEND with that skill set.  You'll probably even think the first one or two projects are easy, since some of it will be review; after that, it will ramp up.  Beyond what you've learned, there isn't much you need to brush up on; you'll be prepaired to enter the Nanodegree right out of the gate.

####What a student needs to know before taking the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree:
- You'll need a good basic idea of how to use a computer
    - How to create files
    - How to use a text editor (not like Microsoft Office, but rather like Text-Edit on Mac or Notepad on Windows, or preferably Sublime Text or Atom)
- A basic understanding of how to code
- Knowledge of web termanology; what is a url, a browser, etc.

####What to learn after IPND but before taking the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree:
Nothing!  You should be ready to jump right into FEND after you finish IPND.

#What will students learn in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree?  

##What is the structure of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree?  
Nanodegree Structure

In the Nanodegree program, you’ll build six portfolio-worthy projects. Depending on your knowledge and skill level, you can either learn the necessary skills through our supporting courses, or jump into the projects directly. A summary of each of these projects, as well as links to their supporting courses are included in the sections below.

##What classes is the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree composed of?  

###How to Use Git and GitHub

You’ll host all your projects on GitHub and make regular commits. If you haven’t learned version control yet, use our latest course on the topic: How to Use Git and GitHub

###Intro to HTML and CSS
You will already have taken most of the first two lessons of this course in Stage 1 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree!

###Responsive Web Design Fundamentals

###Responsive Images

###Project: Build a Portfolio Site

You will replicate a design mockup in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

Prepare for this project with: Intro to HTML and CSS, Responsive Web Design Fundamentals, and Responsive Images

###JavaScript Basics
You will already have taken the first lesson of this course in stage 5 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree!

###Intro to jQuery

###Project: Interactive Resume

You will develop an interactive resume application that reads your resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. You will use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that will display on the resume.

Prepare for this project with: JavaScript Basics and Intro to jQuery

###Object Oriented Javascript

###HTML5 Canvas

###Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone

You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

Prepare for this project with: Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

###Website Performance Optimization

###Project: Website Optimization

You will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

Prepare for this project with: Website Performance Optimization

###Intro to AJAX

###JavaScript Design Patterns

###Project: Neighborhood Map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

Prepare for this project with: Intro to AJAX and JavaScript Design Patterns

###JavaScript Testing

###Project:  Feed Reader Testing

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

Prepare for this project with: JavaScript Testing
