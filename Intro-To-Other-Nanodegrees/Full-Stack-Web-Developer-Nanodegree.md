##What is the structure of the Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree?  
Nanodegree Structure

These are the projects you'll build and the classes that will prepare you to build each of the projects. You'll have access to all these in the Nanodegree:

###Project: Movie Trailer Website

You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

###Course: Programming Foundations with Python
You will already have taken this full course in IPND!

###Project: Tournament Results

You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

###Course: Intro to Relational Databases
You'll explore a different kind of database, similar to the Google Datastore you work with in stage 4 of IPND

###Project: Item Catalog

You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

###Course:  Full Stack Foundations 

###Course:  Authentication and Authorization 


###Project: Conference Organization App

You will develop a cloud-based API server to support a provided conference organization application that exists on the web as well as a native Android application. The API supports the following functionality found within the app: user authentication, user profiles, conference information and various manners in which to query the data.

###Course: Developing Scalable Apps with Python

###Project: Linux-based Server Configuration

You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

###Course: Linux Basics for Web Developers
