Webcast: About the iOS Developer Nanodegree
==========================================

Here is a link to the [video][OH]

#What is iOS Development?
iOS Development is any type of development for the iPhone or iPad.  These two devices run on an operating system called iOS.  Occationally development for the Apple Watch it thrown in under the iOS development umbrella, but that device uses a different operating system than the iPhone or iPad.

#What is the iOS Developer Nanodegree about?
The iOS Developer Nanodegree is what is going to take a student who has basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming, and teaches them the basics of iOS development.  Much like the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, the program is broken into a variety of projects, as well as courses which prepair you to complete the projects.

#Expected Prerequisite Knowledge  
###What is Expected Prerequisite Knowledge to start the iOS Developer Nanodegree?
First, there are the requirements for any Nanodegree here at Udacity:

- You are self-driven and motivated to learn. Participation in this program requires consistently meeting the deadlines set for your cohort and devoting at least 10 hours per week to your work.
- You can communicate fluently and professionally in written and spoken English.
- You are willing to contribute to the success of the program, including collaborating with fellow students and giving us feedback on how we can improve.

There are also iOS Developer Nanodegree Specific Requirements:

- Access to a Mac computer running OS X 10.10 or later.  Basically, you need to have access to the most current version of OSX, so when El Capitan comes out, you will most likely need to upgrade to it as well.  It should have the same technical requirements as Yosemite, though, so hardware shouldn't be a problem when that update occurs.
- Prior object-oriented programming experience, in any object-oriented language
- Strong understanding of programming concepts like variables, if statements, and loops, as well as object-oriented programming concepts like functions and classes
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub, specifically how to: clone a branch, fork, and create a new repository.

There is also a [Readiness Assessment](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-none/l-3098108743); taking that should give you a sense as to your preparedness to enter the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

In summary, before starting the iOS Developer Nanodegree, you should have a strong understanding of programming concepts like variables, if statements, loops, functions, and classes. Additionally, you should have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub, specifically how to: clone a branch, fork, and create a new repository.


###What gaps may need to be filled in from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree?

First, it's probably useful to go over what you will learn (or have learned) in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree:

#####What you learn in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree

#####From Stage 1:
In Stage 1 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as how they fit together.  You'll get practice with developing your own static web pages, building the foundations with HTML and formatting them with CSS.  You'll learn a variety of HTML tags and attributes, as well as how to use them.  

You will also learn how to use various tools common in programming, like a text editor (we use Sublime Text).

#####From Stage 2:
In stage 2 you will learn the basics of Python, including:
1.  Strings
2.  Loops (for and while)
3.  Variables
4.  If statements
5.  Types (like int, str, and bool)
6.  Lists
7.  Tuples
8.  Mutability
9.  Functions
10.  Return statements
11.  Print statements
12.  Debugging Python code
13.  Problem Solving

This will set you up to be able to build your own programs!

#####From Stage 3:
In stage 3, you will continue learning Python, this time getting into its object oriented side.  Here you will learn about:
1.  Classes 
2.  Objects
3.  Methods
4.  Instances
5.  Instance variables
6.  Inheritance
7.  Method Overriding
8.  Import Statements
9.  The Python Standard Library
10.  Importing External Libraries
11.  Using documentation

#####From Stage 4:
In stage 4 of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree, you will build the backend of a website using Python and Google App Engine.  You'll learn:
1.  How to install, run, and deploy with Google App Engine
2.  How to use the .yaml file with GAE (Google App Engine)
3.  How to navigate folders appropriately when referencing different files with GAE
4.  Google Datastore  
5.  How to use the webapp2 framework
6.  How to use jinja2 templates
7.  How to use Python dictionaries
8.  How to use the modulus operator in Python

#####From Stage 5:
Stage 5 in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree will provide awareness of a variety of things instead of providing a higher level of competency.  Some of the concepts in computing you will develop awareness about will be:
1.  Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life.
2.  Using APIs to easily access powerful data.
3.  Recursion 
4.  Parallel computing
5.  How to solve large and long problems. 
6.  Responsive Web Design: How to make web pages look good.

Now we can move into what a student will need to know before taking the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

####Going into the iOS Developer Nanodegree from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree
You should hopefully have developed some level of mastery over object oriented concepts in the Intro to Programming Nanodegree.  It would most likely still be useful to take all of [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101) in order to master various programming concepts.

Additionally, you will need to take [How to Use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) in order to learn how to use Git and Github effectively, which is a requirement for starting the iOS Developer Nanodegree.


#What students will learn in the iOS Developer Nanodegree  

##The iOS Developer Nanodegree Structure 
Nanodegree Structure

In the Nanodegree program, youâ€™ll build five portfolio-worthy apps. Depending on your knowledge and skill level, you can either learn the necessary skills through our supporting courses, or jump into building the apps directly. A summary of each of these apps, as well as a link to their supporting course are included in the sections below.

###Project: [Pitch Perfect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pitch-perfect-portfolio-app/id987684705?mt=8)

Build an app that records a message and plays the audio back through user-selected filters.

####Course to prepair: [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585).

###Project: [MemeMe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mememe-portfolio-app/id994289240?mt=8)

Take a photo, and overlay text to meme-ify your friends. Then share on your favorite social channels!

###Project: [Virtual Tourist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/virtual-tourist-portfolio/id994696845?mt=8)

Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! This app allows you to drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location. You will store the locations and images using Core Data.

####Course to Prepair: [iOS Persistence and Core Data](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-persistence-and-core-data--ud325)

###You Decide!

Landing a job as an iOS Developer requires more than technical chops; it also requires a certain amount of creativity and innovation. Drawing from all of the skills you've developed so far in the Nanodegree, you'll dream up, design, and code your own custom app.
