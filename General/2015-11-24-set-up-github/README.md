Go to www.github.com, and create an account (or sign in if you already have one).  You can create an account by:

- Go to GitHub's Plans & Pricing page.
- Select the appropriate account type and level that you want to create. (You'll want the free version)
- When you're ready with your decision (to go with the free version, probably), click 'Sign up now'.
- Type your username, email address, and password on the next screen.
- Select your plan type. (Again, you'll want the free version).
- Click Finish sign up.

You should also download Github desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/): https://desktop.github.com/

Follow the prompts to install Github desktop.  We'll do the Mac version here; both Windows and Mac should have a straight-forward installation process.

On a Mac, once it is downloaded, go to your downloads folder:

Unzip the file by double clicking on it.  From there, double click the opened app:

![open app](http://i.imgur.com/pyOhgN8.png)

Open the app when prompted:

Move it into your applications folder when prompted:

Now it's installed!

Now that Github desktop is installed and you have an account, create a new repository on the Github website:

![create new repository](http://i.imgur.com/Zv6vbq1.png)

Make sure it is public, like it is by default:

![chose public profile](http://i.imgur.com/nB4lMCE.png)

Give it a name and create a new repository. When it is all set up, clone it in your desktop:

![clone in desktop](http://i.imgur.com/7LMZZHk.png)

It should launche GitHub:

You then make the folder there, and then move whatever files you want to share with others (or us coaches) here. After you move your files, make a comment under the description about what your current edit did, and then commit the changes:

![Commit](http://i.imgur.com/fMompMK.png)

This will save changes locally; now you need to 'push' (or publish) these requests to Github.  You can do this by sincing:
![Sync](http://i.imgur.com/MOEGVqs.png)


Once it is on Github, anytime you want to update what is on Github, you can sinc Github with what is on your local machine by:

1.  Making changes on your local machine and saving them
2.  Commiting those changes
3.  Pressing the 'Sync' button:

![Sync](http://i.imgur.com/MOEGVqs.png)

This will upload everything to GitHub, which will allow us to more easily collaborate with you, since we'll be able to see both your code and the relative position of your files.

You can also create new repositories directly on your local machine, and then publish them to Github before starting the syncing process for new updates.  To do this, start Github desktop.  Create a new repository, with whatever name you want and wherever you want.  This will create a folder in this location by that name!

![create new repository](http://i.imgur.com/3sPqbTI.png)
![save it where you want](http://i.imgur.com/ncesdB1.png)

Then, when you want to upload it to Github, press 'Publish':

![Publish](http://i.imgur.com/37Cdvk0.png)

After it's published you can update it the same way you would if you created it on Github; by syncing it with your changes, as outlined above.
