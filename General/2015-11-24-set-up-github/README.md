I recommend setting up a GitHub account to share what you currently have so we can test things out ourselves. Go to www.github.com, and create an account (or sign in if you already have one).  You can create an account by:

- Go to GitHub's Plans & Pricing page.
- Select the appropriate account type and level that you want to create. (You'll want the free version)
- When you're ready with your decision (to go with the free version, probably), click 'Sign up now'.
- Type your username, email address, and password on the next screen.
- Select your plan type. (Again, you'll want the free version).
- Click Finish sign up.

After creating an account, create a new repository:

Make sure it is public, like it is by default:

Give it a name and create a new repository. When it is all set up, clone it in your desktop:

You may have to download something here to make this work; for me, it launches GitHub:

You then make the folder there, and then move your google app engine folder there. After you move it, make a comment under the description about what your current edit did, and then commit the changes:

This will save changes locally; now you need to 'push' (or publish) these requests to Github.  You can do this with the 'Publish' button:

Once it is on Github, you can sink Github with what is on your local machine by:

1.  Make changes on your local machine and save them
2.  Commit those changes
3.  Press the 'Sync' button:

This will upload everything to GitHub, which will allow us to more easily collaborate with you, since we'll be able to see both your code and the relative position of your files.
