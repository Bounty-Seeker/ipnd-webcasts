I recommend setting up a GitHub account to share what you currently have so we can test things out ourselves. Go to www.github.com, and, after creating an account, create a new repository:


Make sure it is public, like it is by default:

Give it a name and create a new repository. When it is all set up, clone it in your desktop:



You may have to download something here to make this work; for me, it launches GitHub:



You then make the folder there, and then move your google app engine folder there. After you move it, make a comment under the description about what your current edit did, and then commit the changes:



This will upload everything to GitHub, which will allow us to more easily collaborate with you on figuring out what is wrong, since it will update whatever you do every time you commit.
