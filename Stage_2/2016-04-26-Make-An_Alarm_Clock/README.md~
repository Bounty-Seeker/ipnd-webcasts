## Intro
This webcast is intended to show you all the ways you can use programming to think out of the box to solve your everyday needs.
By the end of this webcast, you'll make your very own "alarm clock" that plays your favorite song at any time of the day. You'll learn
a little about cron jobs -- tasks that run in the background on your computer at certain times of the day. You'll also learn how to
open up files of different types on your computer using Python.
